   ##  Reflection (STAR Technique)

### **S – Situation:**  
As a Co-Op Student at Woolworths, I was simultaneously enrolled in academic modules that resumed on **14 July 2025**. This created a scheduling conflict with my usual in-office responsibilities on Mondays.

### **A – Action:**  
I proactively informed my managers, **Xhanti Mkungeki** and **Rudzani Shupping**, about my updated schedule. I then followed up with a formal email to **Lihle Mciteka**, clearly explaining the situation and attaching my **WIL (Work Integrated Learning) letter** as official proof of my academic commitment.

### **R – Result:**  
This transparent communication helped maintain trust and accountability with my team. It also ensured that my academic needs were accommodated while keeping my professional responsibilities aligned.

###  Reflection (STAR Technique)

### **S - Situation:**  
During the **Work Readiness Training**, I participated in an interview preparation session that focused on developing professional interview skills for the **IT industry**. We were guided on how to respond effectively to both technical and behavioral questions, such as describing our **strengths**, **weaknesses**, and **technical projects**.  

### **T - Task:**  
My goal was to prepare myself for real-world job interviews by learning how to confidently discuss my experience, technical abilities, and problem-solving approach. I also wanted to ensure my **Curriculum Vitae** and communication style reflected professionalism and clarity.  

### **A - Action:**  
I reviewed my CV and tailored it to emphasize my IT skills, programming experience, and teamwork involvement in university projects. To prepare for interviews, I practiced answering common questions like *“Tell me about yourself”* and *“Describe a technical problem you solved”* using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). I also studied questions on teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability to ensure I could provide structured, confident responses.  

### **R - Result:**  
Through this process, I gained confidence in expressing my experiences clearly and professionally. I learned how to organize my responses using STAR, highlight my technical achievements, and maintain a positive and composed presence during interviews. This preparation improved both my communication and self-awareness, making me feel more prepared for future internship and graduate opportunities.

### T - Task:
My task was to apply the interview techniques I had learned — such as body language, tone of voice, and structured responses using the STAR method — while presenting myself as a strong candidate for an entry-level IT position.

### A - Action:
Before the interview, I reviewed my CV, rehearsed common interview questions, and practiced explaining my technical skills and previous projects clearly. During the mock interview, I focused on maintaining good eye contact, listening carefully to each question, and responding with confidence. I also ensured that I linked my answers to real experiences, such as group projects and problem-solving tasks from university. Afterward, I received constructive feedback from the facilitator on areas like clarity, pacing, and posture.

### R - Result:
This experience significantly improved my self-confidence and interview readiness. I learned how to handle unexpected questions calmly, structure my answers effectively, and communicate my strengths in a professional manner.
